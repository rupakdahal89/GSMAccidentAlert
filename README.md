# GSMAccidentAlert
This project uses the HCS Dragon-12 development board from Freescale and a GSM+GPS module to generate sms alert in case of an accident.
The user saves the contact phone number to connect to  and when accident happens, an automatic call will be sent to the saved number 
along with the link to Google Maps for the location. An analog accelerometer has been used to detect a sudden change in acceleration along any 
one of the X, Y and Z axis.
